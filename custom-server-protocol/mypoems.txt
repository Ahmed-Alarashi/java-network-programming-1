Love Apart

Even though we are miles apart 
You are never far from my heart
I loved you then
I love you now
It's always when and
Never how
Take me back to yesterday
All the wonderful things you had to say
I loved you then
I love you now
It's always when
And never how
I see your eyes
I feel you near
Although you're not
Really here

I Love You

I know you're there
but my world is so bare.
Nothing is standing in your way,
I'm hoping you can make it one more day.

Our relationship has grown so strong,
where could we have went so wrong.
You were there when I needed you,
Now I'm here for you to need me too.

My love for you will stay the same,
never will I forget your name.
By my side, you will always stay,
I'll think of you day by day.

Mask

I was once sad and lonely,
Having nobody to comfort me,
So I wore a mask that always smiled;
To hide my feelings behind a lie.

Before long, I had many friends;
With my mask, I was one of them.
But deep inside, I still felt empty,
Like I was missing a part of me.

Nobody could hear my cries at night
For I designed my mask to hide the lies.
Nobody could see the pain I was feeling
For I designed my mask to be laughing.

Behind all the smiles were the tears
And behind all the comfort were the fears.
Everything you think you see,
Wasn't everything there was to me.

Day by day,
I was slowly dying.
I couldn't go on,
There was something missing..

Until now I'm still searching
For the thing that'll stop my crying.
For someone who'll erase my fears,
For the person who'll wipe my tears.

But till then I'll keep on smiling.
Hiding behind this mask I'm wearing.
Hoping one day I can smile,
Till then, I'll be here.. waiting.

Unseen

you are trapped in a cage.. 
no one sees it.. not even you..
you don't know what it's made of.. 
you don't even know where it came from.. 
but you feel it.. it's all around you.. 
it is full of strength 
that it forbids you to move freely.. 
it separates you from your wisdom 
and it strangles your thoughts.. 
you are robbed 
but you don't know what was taken.. 
you're in a place 
but you don't know where you're heading.. 
you don't even know how you got there.. 
or who has brought you there.. 
you know you've been through a lot 
but your memories are distorted.. 
it is seizing you little by little.. 
you can't stay but you can't go.. 
you are trapped but no one sees it.. 
NOT EVEN YOU..

Welcome To Hell

'Welcome to Hell," the sign should've read,
Reaching your destination-all in your head!
"Last call for the train heading to Nowhere Fast,"
The memories you create will forever last.
You want to buy a ticket, What's the cost, you ask?
Just hop on board, we'll talk once your trashed.
Close your eyes and picture something grand,
No peeking! Now trust me, and give me your hand!
To a beach with water and the sun shining down,
Open up! No beach here, you're hell bound.
Of course there's water! But it's for your rig and spoon,
Lil' girl, don't be afraid- 14 years old isn't that soon?
The men don't bite, but you'll be messed up beyond belief,
When you do pass out, not remembering- a relief.
Ashamed to face Mommy! Got to have that coke!
Shooting dope everyday, A girl with dreams lost all hope.
I laugh at you as you toss your life in the wind,
To far gone... it's us till' the end.
I'll be there when you loose your pride,
When you forget your morals, I'm at your side.
You'll cheat and steal to have that fix,
Won't take baby to the doctor although she's sick.
Getting a pill- definitely #1 on the list,
Oops. Another appointment baby missed.
Nanny buys diapers because Mommy stays high,
Daddy hits Mommy and the children cry.
After years of this bliss the kids got took,
Mommy is a junkie and fast becoming a crook.
You'll land in jail, a drug addict you remain,
Your heart turns cold as you play the game.
Do not pass go- strip your dignity right here,
This old man wants you, dry your tears,
Quote a price! Self respect long forgotten,
You'd sell your soul to the devil for an Oxycontin.
I told you girl the destination is in your head!
"Welcome To Hell!" Next stop... Well, she's dead.
I told you that I'd stick it out till' the end,
For me, you traded your dreams and kids,
Your Addiction, Life, and your faithful Friend.
